## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About this project

I had a blast putting this together. Attempting to implement Google Tag Manager was my biggest time suck and blocker, as I ran into several conflicting and out of date documentation along the way. Next is somewhat new to me as well, but was super fun to work with. You can view my full journey notes
via this [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/Further-Assessment-207ced52701f804bb063c35cf037e6f6?source=copy_link) page.

For this project I used the [Brite theme](https://bootswatch.com/brite/) from Bootswatch via Bootstrap, Google Tag Manager, and Vercel for deployment.

Future enhancements:
Use Next Rotuer to push page views to dataLayer
